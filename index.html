        Nature is that natural and physical world that surrounds us and makes
        life possible on earth. Nature is the heart of earth. Nature heals us
        and helps build connection with our freedom, authenticity and our souls.
        Simply connecting and feeling nature gives us a divine pleasure. We have
        a strong bond and emotional connection with nature. The serenity of
        nature calms our hearts. The stillness and movement in nature both have
        a hypnotizing effect. The unfolding creativity of nature is an art. It
        is alluring to experience solitude with nature. The practice of devoting
        ourselves to the bliss of nature is soothing and reviving. Everyone
        loves to escape away in the mysteries of nature.

        When we observe and feel the beauty of nature it has such a tranquil and
        soothing effect on our mind, body and soul. It has a lasting effect on
        our senses and gives an amazing feeling of refreshment and delight. When
        we think of the beauty of nature we immediately think of the scenic and
        visual beauty of nature, like the soaring mountains, tranquil rivers,
        greeneries of trees, colors of rainbow, butterflies and birds, and the
        blossoming flowers. Everything about nature gives us the feeling of
        pleasure.
